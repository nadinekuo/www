        <h1>Release Announcement</h1>


        <p>We are pleased to announce the seventh release (code name "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Gauss</a>") of the Einstein Toolkit, an
        open, community developed software infrastructure for relativistic astrophysics. This
        release includes various improvements to the MHD handling within GRHydro, and improvements
        to the Cactus flesh, especially treatment of external libraries. In addition, bug fixes
        accumulated since the previous release in November 2012 have been included.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and
        analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems that builds on numerous software
        efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, the Carpet AMR
        infrastructure and the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics code GRHydro. The Cactus
        Framework is used as the underlying computational infrastructure providing large-scale
        parallelization, general computational components, and a model for collaborative, portable
        code development. The toolkit includes modules to build complete codes for simulating black
        hole spacetimes as well as systems governed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed software model and its different modules are
        developed, distributed, and supported either by the core team of Einstein Toolkit
        Maintainers, or by individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, the
        Einstein Toolkit Maintainers provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the
        toolkit and help coordinate support. The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers currently involve
        postdocs and faculty from six different institutions, and host weekly meetings that are
        open for anyone to join in.</p>


        <p>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include: open,
        community-driven software development; well thought out and stable interfaces; separation
        of physics software from computational science infrastructure; provision of complete
        working production code; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</p>


        <p>For more information about using or contributing to the Einstein Toolkit, or to join the
        Einstein Toolkit Consortium, please visit our web pages at &lt;<a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org">http://einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is primarily supported by NSF 1212401/1212426/1212433/1212460
        (Einstein Toolkit), 0903973/0903782/0904015 (CIGR), and also by 0905046/0941653
        (PetaCactus) and 0710874 (LONI Grid).</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit contains about 200 regression test cases. On a large portion of the
        tested machines, almost all of these testsuites pass, using both MPI and OpenMP
        parallelization.</p>


        <h4>The changes between this and the previous release include:</h4>


        <p>
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Compatibility</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>The following changes lead to potential different numerical results or the need to
        modify optionlists:

        <ul>
          <li>The MPI thorn, as well as several other external libraries, feature an improved
          autodetection mechanism. Most typical installations don't have to set any options to have
          installed libraries detected.</li>


          <li>The parsing code of some ccl files got re-written. Most existing files should work as
          they did before, but there are a few corner-cases, e.g. using double quotes around
          keywords that contain mathematical symbols.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- TODO -->


        <p>
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Larger changes since last release</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <ul>
          <li>New components:

            <ul>
              <li>EinsteinAnalysis/Outflow</li>


              <li>Carpet/CycleClock</li>


              <li>LSUThorns/PeriodicCarpet</li>


              <li>CactusTest/TestFortranCrayPointers</li>


              <li>CactusDoc/CoreDoc</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>updates of various machine configurations</li>


              <li>remove existing default allocations; use local configuration to use these</li>
            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>Cactus flesh:

            <ul>
              <li>Do not buffer output from thorn configuration scripts</li>


              <li>Introduce OPTIONAL_IFACTIVE for thorn dependencies</li>


              <li>Automatically activate required thorns</li>


              <li>Support IBM Blue Gene Q compilers</li>

              for the current and recent Intel compilers (version 13), the 'restrict' keyword is
              disabled in Cactus code by default, because the compiler tends to produce wrong code

        <p>To upgrade from the previous release, use GetComponents with the new thornlist to check
        out the new version.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Remaining issues with this release</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Certain machines need to be configured specially in Simfactory because the remote
          directories cannot be determined automatically just from the username. See the Machine
          notes below.</li>


          <li>Recovering with Carpet: The maximum number of timelevels that can be recovered is
          Carpet::prolongation_order_time+1. This is usually the case, but it is possible to write
          parameter files e.g. with prolongation_order_time=1 that use 3 timelevels. This bug
          manifests in an assert() failure when recovering from checkpoints. The work-around is to
          either increase Carpet::prolongation_order_time or decrease the number of timelevels for
          the grid function in question accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><b>Machine notes</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Kraken: defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $HOME configured for this
          machine. You need to determine $HOME by logging in to the machine.</li>


          <li>LoneStar and Stampede: defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $WORK and basedir
          = $SCRATCH/simulations configured for this machine. You need to determine $WORK and
          $SCRATCH by logging in to the machine.</li>


          <li>Pandora: The LSU system pandora has at the time of writing not only severe problems
          of compiling Cactus (can crash the filesystem), but in part due to this also outstanding
          are some failing testsuite results. Please contact Peter Diener at CCT (LSU) before
          trying to use this machine.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>All repositories participating in this release carry a branch ET_2013_05 marking this
        release. These release branches will be updated if severe errors are found.</p>
